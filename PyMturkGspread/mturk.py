class Survey(object):
    """
    The Survey class for the mturk project.

    This class takes into account any activity regarding a Survey conducted
    through the Amazon Mturk portal. This class presumes that the Survey on
    Mturk is primarily used as:
        - a way to obtain respondents
        - a way to screen respondents

    If the user wishes to conduct the Survey entirely on Mturk without a
    screener, simply set up the Survey, run self.get_mturk_results, and use the
    mturk_results pandas file.

    If the Survey is set up such that Mturk only contains the screener
    question(s), then follow the following steps:
        - call 'self.add_conditions' for each desired filtering parameter
        - call 'self.filter_mturk_results' to get the screened out group
        - call 'self.send_first_mailer' to inform users about the second part
          of the Survey
        - call 'self.send_second_mailer' to remind them, if desired
        - call 'self.award_bonus' if want to add bonus

    Note that in order to use send_second_mailer, you MUST use a subclass that
    is linked up to the results of the second part of the Survey. Currently
    supported platforms are:
        - Google Forms
        - SurveyMonkey (under construction)

    To call self.send_second_mailer, please use one of the appropriate
    subclasses.
