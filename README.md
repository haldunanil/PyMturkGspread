# Overview

The objective of this package is to create an easy way to deploy two-step surveys across Amazon's Mechanical Turk (to generate leads and screen candidates) and Google Spreadsheets (to ask follow up questions). The goal is to keep the payments piece of the interaction on Mturk, while using the survey screening functionalities typically only available through paid services like Qualtrics.
